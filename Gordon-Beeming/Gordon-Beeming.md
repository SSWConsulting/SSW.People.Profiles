Gordon Beeming is a passionate SSW Solution Architect and Microsoft MVP (Developer Technologies) who lives and breathes DevOps.  He's dedicated to helping teams transform their development processes and achieve greater agility, collaboration, and success.

With deep roots in the Microsoft ecosystem since .NET 2.0, Gordon has been leveraging Azure DevOps (and its predecessors) from the early days. He's not just a user; he's actively contributed to the community, co-authoring numerous ALM Rangers guidance documents and even penning books on TFS customization and agile project management.

Gordon also enjoys sharing his knowledge and experiences through talks and workshops, hoping to make DevOps a bit less daunting and a lot more accessible for everyone.

When he's not pushing technology limits, you'll find him training for his next triathlon or enjoying quality time with his family.
