With a strong focus on clean code and best practices, Ben has built applications with complex state management requirements, streamlined backend architectures, and automated deployment pipelines. Constantly expanding his skill set, he is deepening his proficiency in cloud technologies and enterprise-level solutions on **Azure**.

## Backend (Third party integration + .NET Migration)
With proficiency in .NET 8 and EF Core, Ben has a track record of successful Web API implementations and integrating complex third-party services, including **Xero, Power BI, and SSRS**. Recently, Ben led a project to migrate an outdated .NET Framework application to .NET 8, where he has removed **1 million lines** of technical debt, significantly improving performance and maintainability and unblocking the migration progress
