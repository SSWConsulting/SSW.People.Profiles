William is a Solution Architect and **Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies (.NET)** with over 20 years of professional experience spanning multiple industries such as Heavy Engineering, Mining, 3D Graphics, Education and Finance.

With his many years of experience, William has learnt how to adapt to new industries, and this gives him a unique talent for synchronizing with his clients' business languages and processes to successfully build their solutions.

## Application Modernization and Cloud Adoption

He is one of the core engineers at SSW and specializes in developing [Enterprise Cloud Applications](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/web-applications) hosted on [Azure](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/azure).

William has helped some of Australis's largest software companies and financial institutions through Application Modernization processes, [.NET Migrations](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/net-8), and [Cloud Adoptions](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/azure).

## DevOps Technologies

William has a passion for automating [DevOps](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-devops) processes with [GitHub](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-github) and [Azure DevOps](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-devops-using-azure-devops). Definitely not a fan of ClickOps!

He also has experience in using other tools such as VSTS/TFS, BitBucket, TeamCity, Jenkins, Bamboo and Octopus Deploy.

## Development Technologies

* Serverless Computing
* Distributed Systems / Microservices
* Event Driven Architecture

  * Azure DevOps
  * GitHub
  * Octopus Deploy
* Software Development
  * ASP.NET Core
  * Blazor

Software Development and DevOps aren't his only strong points.

## Internal Projects

### [SSW Sophie Bot](https://sswsophie.com/sophiebot)

William lead a team to build a smart office bot that integrates with Microsoft Teams, Skype and Google Assistant.

One major use case for **SophieBot** is to help our SSW State Managers and Clients to find the right developer for any project simply by talking to a Bot using natural human language. SophieBot can determine which developers from any of our offices have the right skills for a project and if they are available to be booked for this project. All the information required to answer this simple query can be spread across multiple systems such as Dynamics CRM, TimePro, LinkedIn, SalesForce, Delve, and more. SophieBot has integrations that can collect all the relevant information and fulfill the seemingly simple query and save the SSW State Managers a lot of time and effort.

Relevant technologies: Azure Functions, Azure Bots, Google DialogFlow Firebase, Azure Table Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Docker, NodeJS, Dynamics 365.

## Training

William is a trainer on the [SSW Azure Superpowers Tour](https://www.ssw.com.au/events/azure-superpowers-tour) at major cities around Australia and Online, and has received top evaluation scores!
