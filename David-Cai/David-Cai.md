David Cai is a Senior Database Developer at SSW, a Microsoft Certified Partner specialising in .NET Solutions. He has been a VB guru since version 4 but loves the power of .NET and you wouldn't find him using anything else but VB.NET now.

David joined SSW as a senior database developer in 1999. Since joining SSW, David has specialised in SQL Server 2000, web site development specifically using ASP.NET technology, undertaking work for a variety of government and private enterprises. After computers, his interests lie in swimming, running, reading and listening to music.

His favourite quote is: *"Rudeness is a cheap imitation of power." *
