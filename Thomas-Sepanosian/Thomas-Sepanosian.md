Thomas Sepanosian is currently completing his Master's in Business & IT. He combines a technical background in Computer Science with a specialization in Enterprise Architecture to bridge the gap between code and business strategy.

With a strong academic background, Thomas is a published author with contributions in IoT, AI, and Distributed Systems; he thrives in environments that require both analytical rigor and practical implementation.

When not tinkering with tech, Thomas enjoys his spare time playing sports, or dabbling in graphic design and music production.
