I serve as the Senior Accountant at SSW, bringing more than seven years of dedicated accounting experience and a deep passion for leveraging technology to solve complex financial challenges. 

My professional journey, grounded in the world of chartered accounting, has led to a close collaboration with our Financial Controller at SSW. Our partnership ensures the seamless operation of SSW, encompassing my responsibilities as a leader in financial reporting and the adept manager of our general finance and administrative functions.

For me, finance isn't just a job; it's a passion. I come equipped with specialized expertise in Xero Accounting, automation, and the intricate world of management accounting. If you're seeking innovative financial solutions, don't hesitate to reach out. 

In my downtime, I find joy in connecting with friends and family through board games. Another passion of mine is the world of literature, as I enjoy the journey offered by the pages of a good book.
