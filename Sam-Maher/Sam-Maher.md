✨ A true Full-stack developer, working across a broad range of technologies from your nuts-and-bolts Web Development with Angular & React, to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) DevOps via Terraform, to Embedded Devices with Raspberry Pi and Docker. Sam loves tackling new technologies and finding the right tool for the job.

♟️ Highly social developer and an enthusiastic problem solver, who loves nothing more than being part of the discussion and working directly with clients to find the optimal solution. Just as comfortable leading a project as he is working in the trenches, always ready for a challenge.

🥁 In his free time, Sam loves exploring new hobbies and building community, whether that be playing footy, whipping up a board game night, going climbing, or gigging with one of his bands.
