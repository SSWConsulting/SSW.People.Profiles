In the IT industry since 1996 in both development and testing roles, Lee has spent most of his career helping software development teams across the world to improve the way they build, test and deliver software. He is a seasoned practitioner, author and presenter in the worldwide testing community.

Software quality remains a critical issue for project success yet modern testing & quality practices rarely seem to be adopted well to focus on delivering great quality products. Lee's collaborative approach and craftsmanship mindset to software testing result in test strategies and approaches that genuinely help to improve the quality of your software. 

Lee is a strong advocate for exploratory testing to maximise the value of human testing and has broad experience of implementing appropriate combinations of automation and human testing to deliver high quality software.
 
He actively contributes to the worldwide testing community, is a frequent speaker at international testing conferences and blogs on testing at [Rockin' And Testing All Over The World](https://therockertester.wordpress.com/).

## Conferences

Lee co-organized Testing in Context Conference Australia 2019 and was the Program Chair for the CASTx18 testing conference in Melbourne. He co-organized the Australian Testing Days 2016 conference and was the co-founder of the TEAM meetup group in Melbourne. Lee has attended and presented at over 30 testing conferences, both within Australia and internationally.

## Testing community

Lee actively contributes to the worldwide testing community, via his blog, articles, presentations for meetups, etc. He is a co-founder of the EPIC TestAbility Academy, a software testing training programme for young adults on the autism spectrum. Lee is the author of [An Exploration of Testers](https://leanpub.com/anexplorationoftesters), a book formed of contributions from the worldwide testing community in which testers share their testing, career and life lessons, with all proceeds being donated to the [Association for Software Testing](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/) to provide grants for testers to run local meetups, etc.

## And outside of work

When not testing, Lee is an avid follower of the UK rock band, Status Quo; hence his Twitter handle @therockertester. He is also actively involved in the vegan community and volunteers for [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/).
