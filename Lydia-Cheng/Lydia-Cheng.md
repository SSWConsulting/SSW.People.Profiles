Lydia is the Video Producer in the SSW TV team.

For the better part of the past years Lydia has been driven by creating and directing stories through video, which means she enjoys a good chat about creativity and storytelling. 

Her background in production, short-video directing, and editing 🎬 gave her a solid foundation for filmmaking and content creation. She has also independently produced micro-films and commercial shorts, which helps her make critical decisions both on set and in post-production to ensure quality and creativity.

Lydia is also a hands-on creator ✨ with a background that bridges both China and the UK. She completed her undergraduate studies in China and her master’s degree in the UK, gaining valuable internship experience in both countries. This has shaped her passion for exploring cross-cultural content creation and given her the confidence to embrace challenges with curiosity and creativity.

Lydia is passionate about sports 🏊‍♀️ (currently learning freestyle swimming while recovering from a foot fracture), traveling 🌍, enjoying concerts, theatre, and live shows 🎶, and connecting with nature 🌱. She also enjoys trying her hand at handicrafts like woodworking and ceramics 🎨.
