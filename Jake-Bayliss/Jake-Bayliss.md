Jake is a Software Engineer with over six years of experience delivering innovative software solutions. His technical expertise spans .NET, React, SQL, the Power Platform, and Azure, enabling him to craft applications that drive business success.

While Jake specialises in .NET development, he also brings over three years of hands-on experience with the Power Platform. He has repeatedly led the successful migration of older custom applications, built in technologies such as VB and .NET Framework into modern, low-code solutions using Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. His work includes designing full-scale business applications for large organisations, modernising legacy logic, and automating complex workflows to improve scalability, maintainability, and user adoption.

Outside of work, Jake maintains an active lifestyle, focusing on running and participating in as many events as possible. When he's not running, he turns to chess as his backup hobby, balancing physical activity with mental growth and continuous learning.
