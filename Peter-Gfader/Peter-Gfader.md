 Peter is a Solution Architect at SSW that mixes Scrum experience with development techniques like XP and Agile. 

Peter is an active developer who enjoys different sports like running, climbing, cycling (MTB / Road), hiking, swimming and surfing.

Peter has worked wth different clients with a lot of different technologies:

*   **An eCommerce website for a well established Australian retailer** 

Tuning the performance of an existing website without touching the code was a tough challenge. Server was IIS 6 on Windows Server 2003 and a ASP.NET v1.1 web app.  

 Additionally, we did some performance tuning of the in house developed website. Reduced the average page load ~10 times.   
 From an average of 4 seconds down to ~0.42 seconds per page 

*   **NRMA**

ASP.NET Dynamic Data application providing funding for Community Grants and Reporting with SQL 2005 back end.

*   **An Australian Utilities Company** 

This utilities company needed an automated and easy to use Rostering and Employee management system to replace their current spreadsheet based system. The system was to manage all the engineers across NSW.  
 Related Technology: Silverlight 2.0, ASP.NET 3.5, Dynamic Data, LINQ to SQL, WCF REST, SQL Server 2005, Reporting Services 

*   **TAFE NSI** 

Existent Webforms 2.0 application needed some bug fixes and code tuning to cope for future changes. By creating unit tests and applying major refactorings the code is easier to maintain in the future and adding new features is easy again

*   **PDS**

Existing client application was hard to maintain and write plugins for. We changed this by providing them with an easy to use application framework that is fully pluggable in VB.NET.

*   **Elcom Technology**

The existent search solution for an ASP.NET web application was very slow and not very accurate. Peter solved this by implementing a search portal based on LINQ2SQL and SQL Server Fulltext search

*   **MIP** 

On site teaching of Reporting services at FirstData

*   **PeakSolutions** 

Training in C#, .NET and best practices for a new line of business application

*   **UTS** 

Peter can also be found teaching [UTS Short Courses](https://it.uts.edu.au/course/shortcourse/programming/) in .NET, SQL Server 2008
