Betty Bondoc, a passionate UI/UX Designer at SSW, combines creativity with technology to deliver intuitive, user-centered designs. Her journey from TV and Marketing to tech began with a transformative web development Bootcamp, followed by a Master’s degree in ICT in Sydney. With expertise spanning product design, front-end development, and creative content production, Betty bridges the gap between aesthetics, functionality, and business goals.

Her designs have consistently driven measurable outcomes, including a standout achievement of reducing process inefficiencies by 50% through thoughtfully crafted web applications. Known for her autonomy, organizational skills, and keen attention to detail, she thrives in both independent and collaborative environments.

Talk to Betty if you want help with:
- Product Design & Management – From concept to launch, balancing user needs with business goals
- UI/UX Design – Research, testing, prototyping, and creating seamless user experiences
- Front-End Development – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for clean, responsive, and accessible code
- Graphic Design – Visual identity, marketing materials, and social media assets
- Videography & Photography – Production, editing, and optimization for digital platforms

Betty is also actively involved in the community, mentoring under the Australian government’s "Be Connected" program and leading the digital media team at her local church.

When she’s not designing, Betty enjoys calligraphy, baking, and board games. She also finds balance through reformer Pilates and capturing life’s moments through video and photography.
