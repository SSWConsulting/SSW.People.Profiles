Betty, an enthusiastic UI/UX Designer at SSW, breathes life into experiences through empathetic design. Leveraging her strong communication skills, she immerses herself in users' perspectives to solve complex problems. Following a transformative 6-month web development Bootcamp in 2018, she has seamlessly transitioned from a multifaceted creative role in TV and Marketing to a tech enthusiast. Since then, she has excelled in diverse roles in UI/UX design, web development, and project management. Eager to solidify her tech foundations, Betty pursued a Master's in Information and Communications Technology in Sydney, deepening her love for the field and embracing Australia as her new found home.

Known for her organisational skills, autonomy, and meticulous attention to detail, Betty excels both in independent work and collaborative environments. Her ability to maintain a holistic perspective allows her to contribute effectively to team efforts while upholding her individual work style. She specialises in creating designs that strike a harmonious balance between aesthetics and functionality, ensuring they not only look visually appealing but also seamlessly contribute to a positive user experience. A standout achievement includes her design of web applications that seamlessly integrate with internal business processes, providing user-friendly experiences for both customers and business owners. Betty's digital solutions have notably streamlined company processes, achieving an impressive 50% reduction.

Beyond the tech world, Betty channels her skills into community service as a digital mentor under the Australian government’s “Be Connected” program and as the head of the digital media team at her local church. Her impact in these roles underscores her unwavering commitment to human connection.
