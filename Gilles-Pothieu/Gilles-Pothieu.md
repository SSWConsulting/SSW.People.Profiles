üñ•Ô∏è Gilles is a Software Engineer at SSW Europe (France) with five years of experience in the Angular and .NET Core ecosystems. He began his career as a web developer, continued as a consultant developer in an insurance company where he contributed to a large-scale application built with a .NET Core, Angular/AngularJS, and MongoDB stack, before becoming a software engineer at SSW.

üí° Patient and driven by curiosity, he enjoys crafting responsive applications with seamless, optimized user experiences just as much as designing scalable, well-structured back-end architectures. He regularly explores new technologies by building small apps, testing emerging frameworks, and deepening his knowledge of modern development practices.

üöÄ Deeply engaged with the latest trends in software development, Gilles is particularly passionate about artificial intelligence and its transformative impact on both technology and society.

ü§ñ With growing experience in AI-powered solutions, Gilles has worked on multiple intelligent tools tailored to specific business needs‚Äîsuch as custom-trained chatbots leveraging vector databases, or complex automation scripts, including systems that automatically translate blog content during static site builds. His hands-on approach allows him to bridge innovation with practical results.

üî• He is also well-versed in implementing TinaCMS‚Äîthe best headless CMS powered by Markdown and GitHub own by SSW‚Äîfor smooth, developer-friendly content management and publishing workflows.
