🖥️ Gilles is a SSW Software Developer at SSW Europe (France), who has been working with the Angular/.NET Core environment for nearly 4 years. He began his career as a web developer and later joined an engineering team that worked on a large application for an insurance company using a .NET Core/Angular-AngularJS/MongoDB environment.  
  
🚀 Always attuned to the latest advancements in the field of development, he is enthusiastic about the emergence of AI that promise to revolutionize not only this domain but also the world at large.
  
💡 Patient and passionate, Gilles enjoys creating responsive applications with user-friendly and optimized UX as much as he enjoys architecting a back-end. Being curious, he enjoys using his free time to explore new technologies by both creating small applications to learn new programming languages and experimenting with emerging frameworks.

🤖 Gilles recently embarked on an ambitious project where he developed an AI chatbot powered by Azure OpenAI. This chatbot is unique because it leverages a vector database filled with custom data to understand and process user queries more effectively.
