Since uni, Victor has built lots of projects including **web applications**, **windows applications**, **embedded systems** across many industries and has also won a number of prizes. He has developed an industrial control application that is used to calibrate industrial instruments, and it's still serving in the factory to this day.  

Victor always likes trying all kinds of cutting-edge techs and learning from them. He loves standards and trying to make everything run in the best way possible.
