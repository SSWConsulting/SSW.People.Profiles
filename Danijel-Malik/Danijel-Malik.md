Due to such a great partnership, they wanted SSW to support their Cruise Control application, which is one of the key websites for P&O. Danijel stepped in and took the project to the next level: besides coding Danij el transformed their processes and moved them from a ticketing system in SharePoint to Scrum with TFS.
