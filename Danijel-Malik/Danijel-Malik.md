Some of his client projects include:  

* **Carnival Australia - Cruise Control**  
Carnival Australia celebrated many successful projects with SSW over the last few years. Due to such a great partnership, they wanted SSW to support their Cruise Control application, which is one of the key websites for P&O. Danijel stepped in and took the project to the next level: besides coding Danij el transformed their processes and moved them from a ticketing system in SharePoint to Scrum with TFS. The month long release cycles were replaced with Continuous Delivery and fully automated deployments to production every few days.
