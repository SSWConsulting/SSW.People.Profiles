David Reidy is a Senior Database Architect at SSW, a Microsoft Certified Partner specialising in .NET Solutions. David built his first computer in 1977 and has been involved with computing ever since. Starting with binary and assembly languages he progressed to Fortran while completing his Astrophysics degree and then moved onto developing in Pascal and C on Apple computers while teaching High School Physics. David moved into the Windows world in 1996 after becoming the owner of a scuba diving shop and needing a point-of-sale system. David started working with .Net technologies when the first PDC alpha became available in 2000 and has now taught C# quite extensively to adults and school students through TAFE and high schools.

When not programming David is also a PADI Master Scuba Diving Instructor and is the author of three books on amateur astronomy, two of which became best-sellers.

His favourite quote is *"All of us are in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars". *
