As a Software Engineer and consultant at SSW, I help businesses turn complex challenges into elegant, reliable software solutions. With over 6 years of experience in software development, Iâ€™ve helped to deliver enterprise systems and custom applications that improve efficiency, reduce costs, and tackle many of the new challenges facing businesses today.

I specialize in the .NET development stack, creating secure, scalable, and high-performance solutions. I work closely with clients to understand their goals and needs to design and implement software that not only meets requirements but also adapts to future challenges.

My approach blends technical expertise with clear communication and a commitment to delivering software solutions on time and to a high standard. Whether modernizing legacy systems or building new solutions from scratch, my focus is always on creating technology that works for the business.

Outside of work, I enjoy immersing myself in video games, socializing with friends through board games and getting lost in a great audiobook.
