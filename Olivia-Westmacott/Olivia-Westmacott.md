Olivia takes care of the day to day administration of the Melbourne office as well as being the Personal Assistant to Michael. This is Olivia's first admin position so she is excited to learn as much as possible from the people at SSW.

In her spare time, Olivia enjoys reading as much as she can, cocktail bartending, and taking short online courses- the more unusual the better!
