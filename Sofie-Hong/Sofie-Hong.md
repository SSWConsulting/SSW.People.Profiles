Sofie is a videographer on the SSW TV team. She has a bachelor's degree in Broadcasting and Television Journalism.

Sofie specializes in capturing people's emotions in interviews and making videos that resonate with audiences. She also values open and honest communication. She is an expert in Chinese social media and the Chinese style of video production.

Like the rest of the SSW team, she believes constant learning is a great way to maintain personal growth.

Her mantra is "To make progress, you need to keep trying new things" - that's why when she's not in the office, you can find Sofie working on improving her filmmaking, watching documentaries, or learning to ski better!
