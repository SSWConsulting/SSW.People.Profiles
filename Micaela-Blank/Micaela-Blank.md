# Micaela Blank – UI/UX Designer

Micaela Blank is a UI/UX designer at SSW with a background in Computer Science and Media Arts. She brings a mix of technical thinking and creative curiosity to her work, with a focus on building digital experiences that are clear, usable, and a little bit delightful.

With experience in both startup and agency environments, Micaela thrives in collaborative, cross-functional teams. She’s especially interested in how thoughtful design—rooted in research and real user insight—can reduce friction, improve accessibility, and tell a meaningful story.

She is currently focused on deepening her user research practice, leading interviews and audits to better understand how people interact with complex systems. Her process is grounded in empathy, collaboration, and a healthy dose of questioning the default.

## Areas she works across

- **User Research & Strategy** – Interviews, journey mapping, interface audits, and usability testing  
- **UI/UX Design** – Wireframes, flows, prototypes, and interaction design  
- **Creative Development** – Interactive visuals, animations, and creative coding  
- **Front-End Collaboration** – Figma, developer handoff, and responsive design  
- **Art Direction** – Visual storytelling and narrative-led concept work

Outside of work, you’ll usually find her painting, swimming, or testing a new audio-reactive shader. She’s inspired by colour theory, real-life quirks, and the occasional weird maths problem.
