**Jean's internal projects:**

- **[SSW.Rules](https://rules.ssw.com.au/)** - Developed a state of the art new SSW website to take 12,000 ASP.NET pages into a SharePoint public site. This site took advantage of SharePoint’s document management, version control and publishing workflow. This new site gave SSW editors a substantially better experience and their website visitors a better user experience.  
   _Related Technologies: SharePoint, ASP.NET, C#, XML, JQuery, Web Services, TFS and SQL Server._

- **SharePoint intranet** - This SharePoint site is used by all SSW employees to store shared resources and provide project management, internal administrative and global search functionality.
