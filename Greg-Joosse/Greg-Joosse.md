After studying overseas, Greg returned to Australia to work for a computer reseller as a System Support Officer. Later, he moved to News Limited as a Network and Communications Engineer. The role developed into Network Manager for News Limited's largest colour pre-press site.

After more than two years with News limited, Greg joined the Super League Consortium as Technology Manager. This exciting position created ground breaking advances for Rugby League and co-ordinated the modernisation of club technology in the office and on the field. Whilst completing his Bachelor of Business at the University of Technology Sydney, Greg also satisfied his interest in computers by programming and indulging in some low-level 'hacking'. He then completed his Certified Novell Engineer in 1992 and then attained the coveted MCSE (Microsoft Certified System Engineer).

His favourite quote is *"If you can't run with the big dogs, stay on the porch." *
