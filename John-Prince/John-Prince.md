John Prince is a Database Developer at SSW, a Microsoft Certified Partner specialising in .NET Solutions. John works mainly with Visual Basic and ASP. He also specialises in packaging up clients and SSW products using Wise and InstallShield. He would rather tidy his office than work with the Package and Deploy Wizard that comes with VB6 and Access.

He is no longer scared of DLL Hell and related distribution problems, but loves working with .NET.

His favourite quote is *"Never give up" *
