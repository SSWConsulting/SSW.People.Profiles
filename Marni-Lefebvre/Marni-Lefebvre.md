Marni holds four degrees, one Undergraduate degree and three Postgraduate degrees. She is an anthropologist by nature and by training, and specialises in the study of sociotechnical imaginaries, which focus on the junction between science, technology, and society.

She has a varied background when it comes to work, ranging from tutoring cross-cultural management and international business at both the Undergraduate and Postgraduate level at The University of Sydney, to being a Graduate Consultant and Administrative Assistant at a communication and reputation consultancy in the UK.

In her spare time she is an avid reader, and she loves to travel and experience new cultures.
