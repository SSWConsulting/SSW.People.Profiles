Sam is the Account Manager for Victoria and also handles leads from Queensland, WA, and South Australia.

Involved in the foundations of every new project, Sam is the first port of call for a new client. He discusses your needs in an Initial Meeting, assessing which of our developers are best suited to help with the project. After this he spearheads a Specification Review, with two talented developers, to lay out a roadmap for the project ahead. Finally, he hands over to your new Development team, who will take the reigns and start work on your new solution. Every step of the way he's there to talk to and relay updates to-and-from the team.

With a passion for technology ignited during his time as a Physics undergraduate at the University of Leeds, Sam manages the majority of clients in the state of Victoria. He is the bridge between our clients and our team, a people person above all else. Devoted to problem-solving and getting things done right, he is extremely versatile and will help drive your business to succeed.

In his spare time, Sam enjoys producing music on Ableton Live, DJing, and attending as many music events as possible. He also loves traveling, learning about new cultures, and seeing the many faces of the world.
