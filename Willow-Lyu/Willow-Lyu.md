Willow is a software engineer based in the SSW Hangzhou office. Before joining SSW, she worked as a product manager for 4 years and later as a full stack developer. Her experience in both roles has given her a strong foundation in understanding user needs, planning projects, and building software solutions from end to end. 

Willow holds degrees from both China and Canada, which has given her a broad perspective and strong cross-cultural communication skills. She enjoys working in diverse teams and values collaboration and continuous learning. 

Willow mainly works with .NET, EF Core, and React, focusing on delivering clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. She is also exploring emerging technologies, including AI-related tools, to enhance productivity and improve project outcomes. 

Outside of work, Willow enjoys reading, especially detective fiction, and exploring new experiences.
