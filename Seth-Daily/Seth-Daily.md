Seth is an SSW Marketing Assistant and Account Manager who loves artificial intelligence and applying it for productivity.

⌛ He's always coming up with time-saving tools using ChatGPT and other AI services, and stays up to date on the latest in the AI world.

📏 He likes improving [SSW Rules](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/) because best practice standards are the fastest way to the optimization of every process.

🎊 He contributes to the [SSW Website](https://www.ssw.com.au/), organizes [events](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/?tech=all&type=all) and is learning account management skills under the guidance of [Uly](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/uly/).

🌎 Originally from California, he lived for a stint in Switzerland and now has a second home in Australia.

🎓 Always learning - in his free time he practices martial arts, plays guitar and piano, and enjoys surfing (which might be why he is based in the great surfing region of Newcastle 😏)
