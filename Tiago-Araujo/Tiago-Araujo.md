Tiago is our favourite creative genius. When he told us he was moving from Australia, we said: "OK, but you're still working remotely for us". We couldn't let him go. After a few years in Brazil, he now lives and works in Canada.  

Tiago is a creative individual who enjoys a challenge. He has 10+ years experience working as a designer for both print and web projects. He also loves spending time playing with Sketch and creating WordPress websites while listening to old songs. Here are some of his skills:

* Specialized in Web UI Design; including websites, apps, blog templates, banner ads and social media assets
* User Experience; including research, testing and prototyping
* Graphic Design; including visual identity and marketing materials
* Semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JS frameworks – focused on accessible, reusable and clean code. He has
developed responsive websites and apps; ranging from concept, layout, mark-up, implementation, testing
and maintenance
* Photography; including production, editing, manipulation, and optimization

Besides SSW's design enhancement projects, Tiago's past clients include Energy Australia, FastAs, WorleyParsons, The Home Loan Company, Carmody Group, Vulcan Steel, AirRoad and Tapp.

Apart from work Tiago is an amateur runner, a Volkswagen Beetle enthusiast, love to travel, and hate olives :)
