Tiago is our favourite creative genius. When he told us he was moving from Australia, we said: _"OK, but you're still working remotely for us"_. We couldn't let him go. This was 10+ years before the pandemic, so we are proud to say Tiago is a trailblazer in the realm of remote work. After a few years in Brazil, he now lives and works in the west coast of Canada.  

With 15+ years experience working as a designer for both print and web projects, he loves spending time designing in Figma or writing clean HTML/CSS for websites and apps... while listening to old songs. Tiago has developed responsive websites and apps ranging from concept, layout, mark-up, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

He is also a Scrum Master and the driving force behind keeping [SSW Rules](https://ssw.com.au/rules) up-to-date. 

Here are some of his skills:

* **User Interface Design** - Websites, apps, and social media assets
* **User Experience** - Research, testing, and prototyping
* **Graphic Design** - Visual identity, and marketing materials
* **Semantic HTML, CSS, Markdown, and JavaScript/JS frameworks** - Accessible, reusable, and clean code
* **CMS** - WordPress, TinaCMS, SharePoint, and more
* **Photography** - Production, editing, manipulation, and optimization
* **Copy writing** - Focused on SEO, formatting, and accuracy

Besides SSW's design enhancement projects, Tiago's past clients include FastAs, WorleyParsons, The Home Loan Company, Carmody Group, Vulcan Steel, AirRoad, Tapp, Nutripath, Berkley, Karras, and more.

Apart from work, Tiago is an amateur runner, a VW Beetle enthusiast, a passionate traveler, and a declared hater of olives ðŸ™ƒ
