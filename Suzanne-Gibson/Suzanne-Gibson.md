Suzanne is the Marketing & Video Assistant at SSW, bringing a dynamic background in marketing, event coordination, video production, and project management. With a Bachelor of Professional Arts in Communication Studies and a background in Broadcast Media Studies, she thrives at the intersection of creativity and strategy, with a passion for community, team collaboration, and the relationship between technology and engagement.

Outside of work, Suzanne is often immersed in a new hobby projectâ€”whether it's learning a new instrument or honing her skills in juggling ðŸ¤¹ and riding a unicycle ðŸš² (though not yet at the same time!).
