Suzanne is the Marketing & Video Assistant at SSW, where she brings a diverse skill set from both the arts and tech industries.

With a passion for community and its relationship to technology, Suzanne has spent the last decade working in film, radio, event management, and marketing. Her degrees in broadcasting and communications have been pivotal in shaping her approach to team collaboration and organizing projects. 

Outside of work, Suzanne is always immersed in a hobby project â€” like crafting or learning to play a new instrument ðŸŽ¸. She enjoys exploring different creative pursuits and is always up for trying something new. She also has a few quirky skills, including juggling ðŸ¤¹ and riding a unicycle ðŸš² (though not at the same time!).
