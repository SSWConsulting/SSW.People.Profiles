Suzanne is the Marketing and Events Coordinator at SSW, bringing a dynamic background in event coordination, marketing, video production, and project management. With a Bachelor of Professional Arts in Communication Studies and a background in Broadcast Media Studies, she thrives at the intersection of creativity and strategy, with a passion for community, team collaboration, and the relationship between technology and engagement.

Outside of work, Suzanne is often immersed in a new hobby that spans a range of creative endeavors, from learning instruments and experimenting with different recipes, to juggling and practicing riding a unicycle (though not yet at the same time!).
