<!-- 🤖 I had some assistance with this one, but I think it paints me in a favorable light without being misleading about my competencies -->

Caleb concluded an illustrious academic tenure by achieving a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with Distinction, a journey that spanned five years of part-time study. Throughout this period, he meticulously honed a diverse set of valuable skills, encompassing networking, communication, project management, and system design. He also engaged in subsidiary coursework where he developed competencies in creating, simple mobile applications, game prototyping and ludology, and business analysis. However, his primary area of interest was full-stack web development.

Embarking on his professional career, Caleb undertook a full-time, 5-month internship with SSW, a pivotal experience that not only refined his technical abilities but also enriched his understanding of the software development industry. This period was instrumental in honing his practical skills as well as soft skills and gaining a real-world understanding of the importance of transparency and frequent, clear, well-documented communication with primary stakeholders in a project. Caleb is committed to creating secure web apps with clean, maintainable code and crafting excellent user experiences.
