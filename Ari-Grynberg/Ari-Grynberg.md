## Overview
As the CPO it is my intention to be across all property matters for all offices – whether that be scheduled maintenance, urgent repairs, planned upgrades, and / or designed relocations or expansions.  I would envisage visiting and checking in on all our offices periodically over time. As is the nature of construction and maintenance, some projects will be small easy fast and seamless, and some will be larger more complex, time consuming, and annoying to staff. Whichever the path, I will always attempt to be in front of the process and demand SSW interests prevail. 


## About me
I am born bred and based in Sydney, and will work from the Sydney office. I will get to all the SSW offices over time. In my spare time I love to get out into nature, and get into the water. I follow all sports (bring back the Bears), a cricket tragic, follow current affairs & politics, and Im a father to 3 teenage kids and 2 irascible mutts.
